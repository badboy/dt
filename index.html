<!-- intro -->

        <h2 id="intro">What's dt? <a href="#intro">⌾</a></h2>
        <p>
          dt is a utility and programming language. The utility is intended for
          ergonomic in-the-shell execution. The language is straightforward
          (in the most literal sense) with a minimal syntax that allows for high
          and higher-order concatenative programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's meant to supplement (<i>not replace!</i>) other tools like awk,
          sed, xargs, and shell built-ins. Something like the Perl one-liners
          popular yesteryear, but hopefully easier to read and reason through.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular dt is intended to be generally useful, with zero
          pretense of elegance. The philosophy might be summed up with some
          <a href="https://www.redgreen.com">Red Green</a> quotes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If it ain't broke, you're not trying.</li>
          <li>...the handyman's secret weapon, duct tape.</li>
          <li>This is only temporary, unless it works.</li>
          <li>Spare the duct tape, spoil the job.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Excuse me, is it "duck" or "duct" tape?</h4>
        <p>
          I mean sure, "duct tape" and "duck tape" are both fine. "Duct tape"
          is the more common name today. The older name is "duck tape" after
          the duck cloth under the adhesive.
        </p>
        <p class="lighter"><i>
          As an aside: If you care about such things, make sure to read up on
          how today's common version became popular. A 51-year-old woman named
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesta_Stoudt">Vesta Stoudt</a>,
          mother of 8, mailed her idea for a better ammunition box seal to the
          president (who approved production) after her bosses didn't do
          anything with the suggestion.
        </i></p>
        <p>Anyway, the goal is to be handy.</p>

<!-- install -->

        <h2 id="install">Installing <a href="#install">⌾</a></h2>
        <p>
          While dt is still experimental, installation will require
          <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html">
          installing cargo</a>. After that, run the following commands:
        </p>
        <pre>
        cargo install dt-tool
        dtup boostrap
        </pre>

        You can confirm that it worked with something like this:

        <pre>
        echo it worked yay! | dt ... upcase words pls
        </pre>

        <p>It should print an enthusiastic three lines saying it worked. (Yay!)</p>
